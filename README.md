# Client_side_defence_against_web_spoofing_using_machinelearning
A browser-based machine learning solution that detects and prevents web spoofing (phishing) attacks in real-time. This project aims to enhance client-side security by analyzing URL patterns and page content through a trained ML model before allowing access, providing an extra layer of protection against phishing websites.
